# Foreword

Hey, so I when I read that I was suppose to take this like a serious project, I went all in.
Designing the app from the ground up. But... this actually worked against me. Plus the fact that
I have not coded in raw PHP in a very.. very... long time.

And so I spent a total of 6 hours.

So...  to the future imaginary developer. Here are the TODOs

* Set up database
* Move products to new db
* Set up models for the Product
* Set up the working controllers and their routes
* Add templating and reuse of templates in the html pages
* Maybe add grunt to automate tasks
