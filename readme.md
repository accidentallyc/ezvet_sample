# Foreword

Hey, so I when I read that I was suppose to take this like a serious project, I went all in.
Designing the app from the ground up. Deciding which design patterns to use and making a flexible app
But... this actually worked against me. I was burning time fast. 

From doing it right, i started doing crutches
and hacks. So reviewer I apologize in advance.

I was adamant on not using js, in hindsight I shouldve.

Plus the fact that. I have not coded in raw PHP in a very long time. 

And so I spent a total of 6 hours.

So...  to the future imaginary developer. Here are the TODOs

* Set up database
* Move products to new db
* Set up models for the Product
* Set up the working controllers and their routes
* Add templating and reuse of templates in the html pages
* Maybe add grunt to automate tasks

# Installation

* move to apache or some php server
* compose install (or install compose then run compose install)
* open localhost:80 or port used by sever
